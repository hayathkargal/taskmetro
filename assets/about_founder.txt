### *Meet the Founder: The Story Behind Taskmetro*

My journey to creating Taskmetro began in the misty, powerful presence of the Jog Falls. Born and raised in Kargal, Sagara taluk, I grew up in a community where people naturally helped one another. My father, H.S. Hassan, a dedicated socialist, politician, and civil contractor, instilled in me the values of service, hard work, and building tangible solutions for people's needs. My mother, Zaibunnisa, created a home grounded in care and support—principles that have stayed with me.

My educational path took me from the local schools of Jogfalls to a B.Sc. in Computer Science at L.B. College, Sagar. This blend of a deep-rooted community upbringing and a forward-looking technical education shaped my worldview.

I arrived in Bengaluru in 1994, full of ambition, and began my professional career as a railway civil contractor. However, my true passion has always been for new ventures and innovation. Over the years, I have been a serial entrepreneur at heart, trying my hand at multiple startups. While these earlier attempts did not take off as I had hoped, each one was a vital lesson in resilience, market understanding, and the relentless pursuit of a genuine need.

This journey would not have been possible without the steadfast belief and encouragement of my wife, Sabeena Hayath. Her unwavering support during the uncertain phases of building this venture was the bedrock that allowed Taskmetro to move from an idea to a reality.

The idea for Taskmetro was born from a very personal observation—a gap I saw not just in the market, but in the lives of people around me. I watched friends, family, and countless professionals who had moved away from Bengaluru struggle with a constant, low-grade stress. The anxiety of a pending bill back home, the complexity of managing property from a distance, or the simple inability to help aging parents with daily errands created a frustrating divide between their new lives and their old responsibilities.

I realized that while the world had gone digital, many essential tasks in our cities still required a trusted, local, physical presence. No existing service reliably bridged this gap with a focus on trust, transparency, and hyper-local expertise.

Thus, Taskmetro was founded with a clear and heartfelt mission: *to be that trusted, extended family in Bengaluru for anyone living anywhere else.* We are not just a task service; we are your peace of mind. We combine the efficiency of technology with the irreplaceable value of human trust and local knowledge.

My own journey—from the community values of Kargal, through the ups and downs of entrepreneurship, to identifying this very real need—is the foundation of Taskmetro. This venture is my commitment to simplifying lives, bridging distances, and building a service I wish had existed for everyone who has ever had to choose between their present and their responsibilities in a city they once called home.

*Welcome to Taskmetro. Let us handle your Bengaluru, so you can fully live wherever you are.*
